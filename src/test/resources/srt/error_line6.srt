00:00:07.472 --> 00:00:09.537
Hello people, welcome to our class today.

2
00:00:10.80 --> 00:00:17.407
We have news here as we are going to record the Seu Elias Kids Collection.
 
3
00:00:17.937 --> 00:00:25.583
It is a children's collection. They are some models that we are going to do with modern hairs in children.
 
4
00:00:25.986 --> 00:00:35.115
Remembering that we are launching the Seu Elias Kids this week at the barbershop, which will be a collaboration
 
5
00:00:35.354 --> 00:00:38.531
both among the barbershop and with the Barber Day Online. Hope you like it. 

6
00:00:38.857 --> 00:00:46.52
It will be a little more summarized class with the aim of creating new things and I hope you like it a lot.

7
00:00:46.293 --> 00:00:47.450
Come on.
 
8
00:00:48.206 --> 00:00:56.219
Cutting children's hair has some peculiarities. In our model's hair, which is Luis, he already
 
9
00:00:56.424 --> 00:01:03.920
is not so young as he is developing in a teenager. So, the particularities are no longer
 
10
00:01:04.296 --> 00:01:10.188
so big. In children's hair I always say that we have to do it fast.
 
11
00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:19.211
Since he starts scratching, to be impatient, the mother begins to be impatient too and that causes
 
12
00:01:19.567 --> 00:01:27.212
discomfort for both the child and the professional. And it ends up being a not very good job.

13
00:01:27.515 --> 00:01:33.291
We are going to cut in a easier way, I do not use division and I do not make so much cut in
 
14
00:01:33.528 --> 00:01:39.884
child's hair to save time and make it a good job but considering the time.

15
00:01:40.217 --> 00:01:48.147
In Luis's hair we will make a lateral gradient and we will also make a crop up and leave
 
16
00:01:48.386 --> 00:01:53.498
the bangs a little shorter forward so that it stays a square but also

17
00:01:53.691 --> 00:01:59.509
summed up to take time into account.

18
00:01:59.918 --> 00:02:07.123
I will always start the gradient with comb one. In the same way I do not divide in this case.

19
00:02:07.447 --> 00:02:17.50
In children's hair like Luis I avoid working hard with a razor, shaver, leaving a lot of scraping.

20
00:02:17.433 --> 00:02:23.58
We do it more, in the case of having to scrape a lot, with a machine at 0 to not cause

21
00:02:23.545 --> 00:02:29.813
an impact as aggressive as we would on an adult.

22
00:02:30.787 --> 00:02:38.948
We use comb 1, both on one side and the other, with very modern hair marking the side

23
00:02:39.378 --> 00:02:46.841
that suits Luis's face a lot and the style we want to do.

24
00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:09.946
Behind the ear I go a finger size with comb 1 or 2, according to your criteria.

25
00:03:54.772 --> 00:04:05.48
Another important tip is, not only in children's hairs, when you are going to make movements and pass the comb 1 or 2,

26
00:04:05.419 --> 00:04:13.256
go in a short way to avoid having to go back to the same area and become repetitive

27
00:04:13.727 --> 00:04:17.760
to the point of tiring your model or client.

28
00:04:21.379 --> 00:04:29.499
It is always important to constantly clean the client so that he is not scratching or uncomfortable.

29
00:04:30.461 --> 00:04:39.837
Following our criteria we will go with comb 1 in this darker area and this

30
00:04:40.273 --> 00:04:44.983
procedure does not differ much from adult hair.

31
00:04:53.559 --> 00:05:00.910
I always talk about the topic of agility in the barbershop because children get impatient, hair starts
 
32
00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:10.301
to fall into their eyes or ears, the child begins to move and be restless which ends up hindering the quality.

33
00:05:10.785 --> 00:05:13.644
The more agile you can be the better. 

34
00:05:14.188 --> 00:05:20.774
We will work with the 1.5 comb above this line that we are doing here.

35
00:05:28.12 --> 00:05:38.926
You can see that I have not done that horse shoe division but I have in my mind the imaginary line

36
00:05:39.321 --> 00:05:45.776
to keep the crown and the edge. The line is not there but it is always in my mind.

37
00:05:50.584 --> 00:06:11.230
After comb 1.5 we return to comb 1. Removing this short shadow that we have here from comb 1 to 2.

38
00:07:02.604 --> 00:07:13.560
It is always important that the hand is light to not make marks on the child's skin as it has

39
00:07:13.809 --> 00:07:18.352
the skin much more sensitive than an adult so you have to be careful.

40
00:07:27.545 --> 00:07:31.798
After moving from comb 1 to comb 2, we will now move on to comb 0.5.

41
00:07:33.967 --> 00:07:45.145
Remembering that we are not going to pass a razor to the point of finishing it as an adult, just to make it a little clearer.

42
00:07:53.30 --> 00:08:00.585
We're going through the process of creating this lightweight mark that you already know from the other videos. Following the same rule

43
00:08:00.940 --> 00:08:12.531
than in the other hairs. I don't usually change my court base or the way to do it, or just because it's an adult or a child,

44
00:08:12.871 --> 00:09:01.414
the concept will always be the same. Follow a normal gradient procedure, like all others. 

45
00:09:07.42 --> 00:09:19.716
There will be people saying, "I wish the child was still like Luis." The truth is that cutting children's hair is not easy. 

46
00:09:20.503 --> 00:09:30.542
But I think it's a good conversation, to talk to them as an equal. In the case of the barbershop we are putting 

47
00:09:30.877 --> 00:09:39.120
video games, strollers for younger children... I think that all that makes it much easier. 

48
00:10:01.116 --> 00:10:10.589
After taking the comb 0.5 we will go to comb 0 low. We will follow the whole procedure

49
00:10:10.852 --> 00:10:15.139
like the others, however, now we are going to get all the hair down here. 

50
00:10:15.927 --> 00:10:20.630
I will not do it only in the middle of the head.

51
00:10:42.371 --> 00:10:45.103
Always be very careful so that the machine does not pinch behind the ear.

52
00:11:43.603 --> 00:11:52.150
I am making the mark and taking out the mark for those clients in which I do not want to use the razor I always do so.

53
00:11:53.115 --> 00:12:04.260
I really believe that in all barbershops what they do the most are degraded, and I don't use the razor since 

54
00:12:04.500 --> 00:12:09.292
not all customers like the razor...

55
00:12:10,607 --> 00:12:14,358
So, in the day to day, in the barbershop, that's how we do it.
 
56
00:12:15.829 --> 00:12:22.759
Of course, we have clients where we scrape, but in other clients we prefer not to scrape so much.

57
00:13:22.443 --> 00:13:31.114
Remember to always be cleaning. Is very important, especially when it comes to children.
 
58
00:13:31.947 --> 00:13:36.257
Otherwise, they begin to lose patience and be restless.
 
59
00:13:37.521 --> 00:13:47.83
The next step is to wet the hair. I told you earlier that I am going to make a crop but I have doubts since his hair

60
00:13:47.386 --> 00:13:53.442
is very pretty. Maybe I do something modern-cut or something.

61
00:14:05.435 --> 00:14:15.560
Although in a hair like Luis I will not do much cutting or division, I need to make a lock as a guide
 
62
00:14:16.170 --> 00:14:23.764
to make everything the same size. Before making that lock, I work with Babum's grooming,

63
00:14:24.92 --> 00:14:36.91
As you know, they will help me both to finish the hairstyle and to divide. We wet it a lot.

64
00:14:36.920 --> 00:14:42.49
Since I want to work my hair in a very good way and we are going to take some pictures,
 
65
00:14:42.742 --> 00:14:51.104
I will not get much hair since I want to have a little length in this hair.
 
66
00:15:09.305 --> 00:15:15.288
Continuing we will make a central section in the same way.

67
00:15:35.641 --> 00:15:40.506
It is always important to make that clean separation to move the center line. 

68
00:15:45.608 --> 00:15:51.510
I will start from the center. And since I want to leave the upper part, I will start at the front.

69
00:15:56.702 --> 00:15:59.902
I'm going to leave my comb and I'm going to cut that straight strand.

70
00:16:01.527 --> 00:16:06.332
My hand will always be diagonal to leave that upper part bigger.

71
00:16:07.196 --> 00:16:25.587
Here too. And here too. It is only to define the size of the entire hair. 

72
00:16:31.292 --> 00:16:35.500
After having defined it we can make the famous, lock by lock. 

73
00:16:35.953 --> 00:16:43.548
And what is lock by lock? I will distribute that central hair lock inside the hair and I will take
 
74
00:16:43.884 --> 00:16:51.276
sections in the horizontal, put it up and find my guiding lock of hair.
 
75
00:16:51.659 --> 00:16:57.859
Look at it here in the center. Then, I cut straight based on my guide.

76
00:16:58.711 --> 00:17:21.481
Here she is again. See here again. And we make a normal lock to lock.
 
77
00:17:24.278 --> 00:17:29.909
We must always have a guiding lock of hair to not make random strands. 

78
00:17:30.509 --> 00:17:37.112
In the next section we will take the same way but with my hand at 90 degrees.

79
00:17:37.741 --> 00:17:42.124
I can't rest my hand since I want Luis's hair to stay more square.

80
00:17:54.313 --> 00:18:04.220
There is very little hair on the sides. Can you see it? Where more hair has gone so far has been in the center.

81
00:18:17.686 --> 00:18:23.942
We carry all the sections for the horizontal and to align this hair, if I have cut all the sections 

82
00:18:24.217 --> 00:18:28.383
in the horizontal, let's do it now in the vertical. 

83
00:18:30.413 --> 00:18:50.617
I take it in the same way leaving the toupee always bigger. Always taking very little and keeping a straight hand.

84
00:18:55.342 --> 00:19:04.843
Remembering an adult cut with a child cut, the more the child cut is similar to the adult cut the better.

85
00:19:05.772 --> 00:19:14.605
In this case here, Luis has a more teenager face and that is the concept that 

86
00:19:14.987 --> 00:19:19.17
we will explore in the collection photos too. 

87
00:19:19.396 --> 00:19:25.797
We are not going to make the models wear a Captain America or Power Rangers shirt; we are going to put a

88
00:19:26.85 --> 00:19:33.908
more classic style with blazer and glasses to make them look more adult.

89
00:19:34.322 --> 00:19:41.47
I think it's a very good concept and I have the whole collection in my mind now. 

90
00:19:45.293 --> 00:19:54.76
Well, to connect this hair and pull this mark, I'm going to take it out almost all and I'm going to leave it a little darker.

91
00:19:54.644 --> 00:20:05.509
We make a diagonal division backwards, taking here from the usual side as we always do.
 
92
00:20:09.47 --> 00:20:14.953
However, I am going to connect also here in a more practical way which is as if we were making a lock by lock. 

93
00:20:16.54 --> 00:20:24.189
See. You have to remember whenever my hand can't be lying down, it always has to be
 
94
00:20:24.500 --> 00:20:29.115
straight so you can make his hair more square shaped. 

95
00:20:29.908 --> 00:20:39.15
If you prefer to grab it as I am doing here, there is no problem. On the contrary, you can grab it this way too. 

96
00:20:40.45 --> 00:20:44.63
You hold it, leave the comb and cut straight.

97
00:20:55.527 --> 00:21:02.679
Generally, when they are children, I like to hold it in a more practical way to be a little faster
 
98
00:21:03.559 --> 00:21:15.862
since children don't let it take a long time. There is no need and children, sometimes, will not help much being still. 

99
00:21:16.847 --> 00:21:29.365
We go here again. We separate from side. Then, I put a finger on the root.

100
00:21:50.327 --> 00:21:56.545
Now I'm going to start taking a bit of this slope. Scissor and comb. 

101
00:22:12.580 --> 00:22:19.810
I will only throw away the excess of this shadow and it is very important that I clean the hairs of the client's eyes. 

102
00:22:27.365 --> 00:22:30.959
Be very careful not to reduce much in the edges area.

103
00:23:04.256 --> 00:23:15.680
Slide comb. It is very important to do the comb job very well. Today students come to me and we have a subject 

104
00:23:16.12 --> 00:23:21.173
totally dedicated to the comb and we work with mannequins.
 
105
00:23:22.750 --> 00:23:31.53
We know if they have a good grip on the scissors, they know how to make divisions but at the time of doing the sliding comb
 
106
00:23:31.424 --> 00:23:39.366
it is a common difficulty. Almost everyone who comes has a lot of difficulty. 

107
00:23:39.709 --> 00:23:47.149
So, the sliding of the comb has some peculiarities that if they are not really respected 

108
00:23:47.491 --> 00:23:49.467
you can't have a good comb slide. 

109
00:23:54.262 --> 00:24:04.272
Always work the thumb and the blades always aligned with each other, both the bottom and top. 

110
00:24:06.489 --> 00:24:12.974
Having done that, we now go with the scissors to remove some of this shadow. 

111
00:24:18.768 --> 00:24:28.361
I have already spoken several times about the scissors and the ideal is to always cut with the teeth on the top. 

112
00:24:37.110 --> 00:24:54.537
We are removing the excesses but not taking everything out to leave a little shadow on the sides
 
113
00:24:55.520 --> 00:24:57.958
without it being too strong or too dark. 

114
00:27:26.460 --> 00:27:37.720
People, now up here we can do a checking with the jagged scissors as I am going to do now.
 
115
00:27:39.2 --> 00:27:49.951
What am I going to do now? I will take sections in the horizontal, I will place a finger at the root and 

116
00:27:50.660 --> 00:27:55.833
I'm going to give two or three jaws near the tips. 

117
00:27:59.293 --> 00:28:03.963
Just to leave the hair a little more disconnected and light.

118
00:28:17.503 --> 00:28:27.864
I am not doing this to drain too much the hair but with wisdom not to detonate much the hair, 

119
00:28:28.173 --> 00:28:30.583
moreover, to not detonate anything.

120
00:28:53.414 --> 00:29:06.787
We are going to go to a more creative part where I am going to style his hair a little. In the front, here,

121
00:29:07.476 --> 00:29:30.686
I'm going to get some hair with the 1.5 comb just so it stays a little more stylized and not so traditional and formal.

122
00:29:34.946 --> 00:29:49.637
Just to give it a more European look and we're going to style a little here making a small line or something.

123
00:30:04.495 --> 00:30:05.425
Do you like the beard? 

124
00:30:05.726 --> 00:30:06.754
Yes I like.

125
00:30:06.997 --> 00:30:08.507
Do you? You don't have any yet. 

126
00:30:09.53 --> 00:30:11.746
My father has a big beard. 

127
00:30:12.27 --> 00:30:17.523
He has? And you're going to have a beard too, boy. 

128
00:30:28.450 --> 00:30:34.501
Let's dry it a little to see how the hair is looking.
 
129
00:31:16.329 --> 00:31:28.351
You can see that although the hair has been done with a little more agility, without so much division,

130
00:31:28.855 --> 00:31:35.842
the basic requirements are always respected. They cannot be forgotten.

131
00:31:36.536 --> 00:31:44.611
The edges, crowns, this more ascending frontal part... is it very important.

132
00:31:45.917 --> 00:31:53.201
We are going to do a little detail here in the front, to level a bit as we usually do so.

133
00:31:58.228 --> 00:32:01.988
And it will be a stylistic detail that will be better for photos.

134
00:32:05.108 --> 00:32:14.573
I always like to do a cleaning with the razor, as I did before, because it always stays clearer and cleaner.

135
00:38:05.511 --> 00:38:12.872
We are going to correct in this frontal part. Now we are cleaning the front to remove only the excess, 

136
00:38:14.467 --> 00:38:18.485
gently not to hurt the skin.
 
137
00:40:24.503 --> 00:40:33.707
This frontal alignment is very important that it is straight and even but always remembering that perfect does not exist.

138
00:40:37.940 --> 00:40:44.537
It is always important to keep an eye on the mirror, take a walk... 

139
00:40:45.536 --> 00:40:51.634
I really like to scrape against hair growth so it takes a little longer to grow. 

140
00:41:16.903 --> 00:41:27.381
I have doubts in matching and correcting here but I am not going to do it, I prefer to leave it as it is eye-catching as well. 

141
00:41:28.403 --> 00:41:37.457
The conventional thing is to make a square but I like to leave it a little more different than the rest of the market.

142
00:41:40.830 --> 00:42:04.452
I use the pencil to leave it a little bigger and on the side. I use pencil in both the photos and the video, however,
 
143
00:42:04.768 --> 00:42:14.281
in the day to day we do not use it. In the production it is very important to have makeup and a complement for these parts
 
144
00:42:14.852 --> 00:42:31.630
that are clearer and inaccurate. I think the pencil colors these edges a little more.
 
145
00:43:37.634 --> 00:43:51.633
People, I'm going to make a little detail in his hair. Today for social networks or photos, just cut

146
00:43:51.890 --> 00:43:58.22
the hair does not attract much attention, you will always need a little detail or an extra.
 
147
00:43:59.304 --> 00:44:06.931
In this case, I think it will be very good to make a small simple detail but that will attract attention. 

148
00:44:55.722 --> 00:45:11.333
Now we take the razor to do only in the shaved area. I usually wet it with a bit of water to not put an excess of saving cream.

149
00:46:02.135 --> 00:46:09.666
Now with comb 1 to remove only that excess of the gradient which will make it a little more marked. 

150
00:47:14.576 --> 00:47:23.656
This line is very traditional and we do it a lot of adults hair. As I told you before 

151
00:47:23.970 --> 00:47:29.246
the proposal is not to make a child's hair but an adult hair in children. 

152
00:47:29.754 --> 00:47:37.813
So, both the look and the hair have to be inspired and with a more adult touch. 

153
00:47:42.408 --> 00:47:50.14
Let's texturize a little up here scissoring with the tip of the scissors.
 
154
00:48:00.99 --> 00:48:01.637
So that the hair stays a little looser. 

155
00:48:39.158 --> 00:48:49.209
To finish our model hairstyle I will use only a little brush here. 

156
00:49:08.668 --> 00:49:14.604
And finally, to end the client's hair, I'm going to use Babum's ointment powder. 

157
00:49:15.178 --> 00:49:21.816
Why do I like this Babum ointment powder? Because it will give me volume and I need it to work well 

158
00:49:22.122 --> 00:49:28.94
the final touches and stylization of the hair. I want volume. 

159
00:49:32.480 --> 00:49:45.53
And then I will also work with Babum's matt ointment. We put a not very large amount and 

160
00:49:45.504 --> 00:49:57.926
we go through the entire hair. Let's stylize it in general. 

161
00:50:06.257 --> 00:50:17.237
Even in child's hair we respect all the requirements such as leaving it squared shape, respecting the crown, the edge...
 
162
00:50:29.434 --> 00:50:38.927
Now we are going to use the Babum spray to fix the hair well.
 
163
00:51:08.386 --> 00:51:17.760
A very important detail in the completion not only of a child's hair but in any hair,
 
164
00:51:18.287 --> 00:51:22.374
it is always important that the client leaves clean.

165
00:51:27.847 --> 00:51:35.996
People, he have already finished the our model's hair, Luis. It's a hair with a more adult style with a big toupee,
 
166
00:51:36.756 --> 00:51:50.27
I have made that line more curved and concave, the front alignment, I have preserved the edges, the normal upward toupee,

167
00:51:50.635 --> 00:51:57.421
crown preserved... Its gradient has not been so bold because it is possible that the mother could not be 

167
00:51:57.780 --> 00:52:02.15
so satisfied and, in children's hair, it is important to always be careful with.

168
00:52:02.446 --> 00:52:05.849
I hope you liked it, see you in the next video. See you soon!
